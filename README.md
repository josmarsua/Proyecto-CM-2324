# Event Buddy - Join the fun with Event Buddy, events for everybody

## Description

EventBuddy is a social media app designed for users to discover and share events, both public and private, in their local area or beyond. With a user-friendly interface and easy-to-use search tools, EventBuddy makes it simple to find events by location, genre, pricing, and more.

## Features

### Registered Users

- Access to private events: Registered users can attend or view private events shared by their friends or network, whereas non-registered users are limited to browsing public events.
- Event creation and sharing: Registered users have the ability to create their own events, both public and private, and share them with friends or the broader community.
- Personalized event recommendations: With a registered account, EventBuddy can offer personalized event recommendations based on user interests, preferences, and past behavior, helping users discover events tailored to their tastes.
- Calendar integration: Registered users can benefit from seamless integration with Calender, making it easier to keep track of their events and schedules.
- Save and manage events: As a registered user, you can save events you're interested in, and receive reminders or notifications about upcoming events.
- Participation in the community: Registered users can contribute to the EventBuddy community by rating events, providing feedback, and engaging in discussions, which helps improve the overall user experience and event discovery for others.

### Non-Registered Users

- Limited event access: Non-registered users can only browse and view public events, without access to private events or detailed attendance information.
- No event creation or sharing: Non-registered users cannot create or share events with others.
- No personalized recommendations: Non-registered users will not receive personalized event recommendations based on their interests or preferences.
- Account prompt: There will be a constant prompt offering non-registered users the option to create an account for a better experience.

## Usage

- Unregistered users: Browse and filter public events to find those with the most attendees.
- Registered users: Access private events from friends, in addition to public events, and have the ability to create, share, and attend events.

## Roadmap

Here are some planned features and improvements for EventBuddy:

- User-curated event collections: Allow users to create and share curated collections of events based on their interests or specific themes (e.g., music festivals, food events, or outdoor activities). This feature can encourage user engagement and provide additional ways to discover interesting events.
- In-app event reminders: Implement a simple in-app reminder system that sends notifications to users about upcoming events they've shown interest. This helps ensure users don't miss out on events they want to attend.
- Event rating and reviews: Allow users to rate and review events they've attended. These ratings and reviews can help other users make informed decisions about attending events and provide valuable feedback for event organizers to improve future events.
